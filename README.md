## Arduino Code for Temperature Dispaly with LCD and LED

C++ Code for an Arduino that allows for an LCD screen to display the current temperature along with high and low temperatures from the last hour and since power on. Also allows for an LED's colour to be changed based on temperature.

Allows for communication via a USB serial cable with the GUI in https://github.com/darthidk/TemperatureGUI which is used to change settings such as default behaviour, pin placements of various wires from the Arduino along with low and high bounds for temperature to affect LED colour.

Developed in VSCode using PlatformIO extension which allows for additional tools as well as easier development of Arduino code. Arduino code contained in src folder.
